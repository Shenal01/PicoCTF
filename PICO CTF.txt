05 - Flag shop
integer overflow in the calculation of total_cost. An integer in C typically has a range of values it can represent. For a 32-bit integer, the range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
2,147,483,647/900 = 2386092

total_cost = 900 * number_flags;
account_balance = account_balance - total_cost;

If number_flags is a large positive value (like 2386396), the multiplication 900 * 2386396 will result in a value that exceeds the maximum positive value that a 32-bit integer can hold. This will cause an integer overflow, and the value of total_cost will wrap around and become a negative value due to the way two's complement representation works. Then we can get the flag.

To fix this issue, you can use a larger data type, such as long long, which can hold larger .

07 - GO AHEAD

In this challenge we need to change the https request 
there are many req methods such as GET, POST, HEAD

HEAD - Purpose: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers of the response, not the actual data.
USING BURPSUITE change the req and forward it the you'll get the flag.

wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b7cabaae6561256c50728d3515db3058/crackme.py 

download the file and 

vim or nano crackme.py

comment the part in the code that gives us the largest number we need to get the flag there for change the code

bezos_cc_secret = "A:4@r%uL`M-^M0c0AbcM-MFE07b34c`_6N" this is the ecooded secrect we'll print it out.

112	p	0x70
113	q	0x71
114	r	0x72
115	s	0x73

then the answer is picoCTF{p}


10 - Who are you

in this challenge we need to change request headers 
i used a extension called "Mod header"
then i changed header requests according to the challenge and got the password.
